    """Abstract base class for all parser combinators.

    Inheritors of this class must:

    1. Implement the ``_consume`` method
    2. Implement the ``__repr__`` method

    Attributes:
        protected (bool): The metaclasses set this flag to true whenever a
            parser is assigned to a name. Operators that flatten the parsers
            they receive (``__or__`` and ``__and__``) will not flatten parsers
            with a ``True`` value here. This is most important for ``__and__``
            because there is no other way to tell that these two should be
            different:

            ```
            abc = a & b & c  # returns [a, b, c]
            ```
            ```
            temp = a & b
            abc = temp & c  # returns [[a, b], c]
            ```

            The fundamental limitation is that python does not handle linked
            lists well or have unpacking that would let one unpack abc as
            [temp, c].
        name (Optional[str]): A name used by ``__str__`` and ``__repr__``.
            It is set by the context classes when a parser is assigned to a
            name.

        This is a concrete wrapper around ``consume``. This method implements
        the left-recursive packrat algorithm:

        1. Check the memo if this parser has already operated at this location
            a. Return the result immediately if it is there
        2. Put a ``None`` in the memo for this parser at this position
        3. Invoke ``consume``
        4. Put the result in the memo for this parser at this position
        5. Return the result

        Individual parsers need to implement ``_consume``, but not ``consume``.
        But all combinations should invoke ``consume`` instead of ``_consume``
        on their member parsers.
